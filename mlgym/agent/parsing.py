Parser module for handling model outputs in the MLGym framework.

This module provides a collection of parser classes that handle different formats
of model outputs. Each parser is responsible for extracting thoughts and actions
from model responses in specific formats (JSON, XML, markdown code blocks, etc.).
The module supports extensible parsing through a registry pattern.
